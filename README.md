# NETWORK-MANAGEMENT-USING-SDN-and-NFV
This project builds on the idea of emerging concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The basic notion of SDN is separation of Data  and Control plane whereas the NFV is to interchange dedicated network appliances with  software running on servers. The main concept behind project V-NM is to replace the traditional  network management by modern approach using the above mentioned techniques. OpenFlow  protocol and OpenStack framework are used in the implementation of this project, which allows  to manage SDN and NFV with great flexibility
